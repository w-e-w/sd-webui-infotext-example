this is an example of how to read and write infotext when developing an extension for [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

three examples are provided [`basic`](scripts/infotext_example_basic.py) [`advance`](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py) and [`selectable script`](scripts/infotext_example_selectable_scripts.py).

the explanation is written as inline comments

read the [`basic`](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py) first then the [`advanced`](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py) or [`selectable scripts`](scripts/infotext_example_selectable_scripts.py) example or if applicable.

[`basic example`](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py) should work for simple extensions.

[`advance example`](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py) is for extensions with lost of info to write and would prefer to write it in a more structured way.

[`selectable script example`](scripts/infotext_example_selectable_scripts.py) is for selectable dropdown scripts, it demonstrates how to allow automatically switch to the script.
