> this is an extension for developers it serves no purpose for the end user 

this is an example of how to read and write infotext when developing an extension for [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

two examples are provided [basic](scripts/infotext_example_basic.py) and [advance](scripts/infotext_example_advance.py).

the explanation is in line
read the basic first then the advanced example if it's applicable to your extension.

basic example should work for simple extensions

advance example is for extensions with lost of info to write and would prefer to write it in a more structured way
